# Introduction

Stellar Design System (SDS) is an opinionated React component library (we hope
it will grow into a full-featured design system in the future) used in the Stellar
Development Foundation’s web projects. It's meant to be used internally to keep
our web products consistent.

## Current version

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stellar/design-system">
  <img

    alt="npm version"
  />
</a>

## Tech stack

- TypeScript
- React for UI
- Sass for CSS styling
- Yarn
- Webpack

## Get started

Install SDS by using the package manager of your choice.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @stellar/design-system
```

Add Google Fonts (`Inter Tight`, `Inter`, and `Roboto Mono`) to the `index.html`
file.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter+Tight&family=Inter:wght@400;500;600&family=Roboto+Mono&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Add the main CSS file to your project (for example, the main `index` file of
your React project).

```javascript
import "@stellar/design-system/build/styles.min.css";
```

Import components in your project.

```javascript
import { Button, Input } from "@stellar/design-system";
```

## Local development

The design system repo has two parts:

- `@stellar/design-system` - everything for the design system
  ([repo](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-design-system/tree/main/%40stellar/design-system))
- `@stellar/design-system-website` - website for the design system (what you are
  looking at now)
  ([repo](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-design-system/tree/main/%40stellar/design-system-website))

To run Stellar Design System locally:

- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stellar/stellar-design-system.git
```

- Install dependencies

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

### Scripts to develop and build locally

- `build:sds` - build Stellar Design System (sds) project only
- `build:sds-web` - build Stellar Design System website (sds-web) project only
- `build` - build both projects
- `start:sds` - start sds project for local development
- `start:sds-web` - start sds-web project for local development
- `clean` - delete node_modules and build directories in the whole repo

:::info

You need to run each `start` command in its own window or tab.

## Developer notes

- Use the Stellar Design System components "as is", don’t modify existing ones to fit
  your needs if the component doesn’t allow it.
- If a component doesn’t exist, it’s okay to create it locally for your project
  (we’ll keep adding more components to SDS as we go).
- If you are creating a component locally, use only color variables available in
  the SDS palette (in `theme.scss`). This is very important for the light and
  dark modes to work. When in doubt, please check with the Design team.
- `styled-components` are not currently supported, but you can use them as
  wrappers/containers for SDS components.
